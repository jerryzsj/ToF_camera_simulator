# ToF_camera_simulator
ToF camara simulator to capture point clouds from STL mesh models

This C++ project implements the simplified Kinect sensor model:

		camera_width = 1280 pixels
		camera_height = 720 pixels
		camera_focal_length = 1160 mm

The C++ codes were implemented based on project "render_kinect" at https://github.com/jbohg/render_kinect

This implementation was simplified with perfect Kinect model without any error or noise.
The implementation focused on simulated scene with multiple cameras.
